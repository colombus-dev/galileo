# Report assets

This folder contains binary assets referenced by the report chapters in `docs/rapport/`.

- `screenshots/`: UI screenshots used in the appendices (Section 12.1)
- `deliverables/`: optional large deliverables (PDF, video, questionnaires) referenced in the appendices (Section 12.6)

## Suggested conventions

- Prefer `.png` for screenshots.
- Use a consistent prefix such as `12.1-...` to match the appendices list.
- Keep filenames stable (so links in Markdown remain valid).
