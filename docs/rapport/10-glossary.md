# 10) Glossary

**ML**

Machine Learning.

**Jupyter notebook**

An interactive document that contains code (often Python), Markdown text, and execution outputs such as tables and plots.

**.ipynb**

The file format used by Jupyter notebooks. It stores notebook structure and content as JSON.

**Storytelling workspace**

The application space where an imported notebook is restructured for guided reading: table of contents, sections, summary, and interactive code.

**Artefacts**

Key elements extracted or inferred from a notebook that help evaluate quality, completeness, and performance (data, visualizations, metrics, code, models).

**Patterns**

Recurring practices or structures identified in notebooks (e.g., validation strategy, evaluation methodology). In the prototype, patterns are represented using mocked data.

**Mock / mocked data**

Simulated data used to test and visualize features without having reliable real extracted results. Useful to validate UI and user flows.

**localStorage**

A browser storage mechanism used to persist small amounts of data locally (e.g., notebook import history).

**IndexedDB**

A more robust browser database than localStorage, adapted to larger and structured data.

**Cell-by-cell view**

Code display mode where notebook code is shown as distinct cells to follow reasoning step-by-step.

**Grouped / single-block view**

Code display mode where code cells are concatenated to read the notebook like a single script.

**Token**

A clickable element extracted from code (function name, import, symbol) that can be associated with documentation.

**Side documentation panel**

A UI panel that displays detailed information about selected tokens.

**Heatmap**

A visualization representing frequency/intensity of an element (e.g., most/least frequent patterns).

**Radar chart**

A visualization comparing multiple metrics on the same plot, useful to spot strengths/weaknesses.

**Comparison mode**

A feature that juxtaposes multiple notebooks to analyze differences and similarities in code, artefacts, or performance.

**Overlay**

Additional information injected on top of imported notebook data to complete missing information in the prototype.

**UX (User Experience)**

The quality of the user’s experience while using the application: navigation, readability, interactions, understanding.

**SPA (Single Page Application)**

A web application where navigation does not require full page reloads.

**Parsing**

The process of reading and interpreting a file (here a notebook `.ipynb`) to extract structured data.

**In-memory cache**

Temporary storage inside the application to speed up access and avoid repeated processing.
