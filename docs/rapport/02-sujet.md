# 2) Problem statement & context

## 2.1 Problem

- What concrete problem are we trying to solve?
- What are the current pain points (time, errors, lack of readability, lack of traceability)?

## 2.2 Context

- Educational / industrial context
- Current flow: notebook import → artifact extraction → comparison → storytelling

## 2.3 Users

- Personas: evaluator / teacher / student / data scientist
- Goals per persona

## 2.4 Scope

### In scope

- Notebook import
- Artifact extraction (datasets, metrics, visualizations, models)
- Pages: artifacts (single + comparison), patterns, storytelling

### Out of scope / non-goals

- (Examples) remote execution, long-term storage, multi-project management, authentication

## 2.5 Assumptions and constraints

- Available data (mock vs real notebook)
- UI/UX constraints
- Accessibility constraints (WCAG)

## 2.6 Success criteria

- Measurable criteria:
  - Time to compare 2 notebooks
  - Quality/completeness of metrics
  - Coverage of use cases
  - Accessibility (AA) on key pages
